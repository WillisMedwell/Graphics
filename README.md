# Graphics
An experimental project exploring a range of tools, techniques, and topics related to graphics (OpenGL). Using Emscripten, the project is also portable to the web. The repo is broken into several projects:
- **Engine** is the core rendering and window management.
- **Demos** provides the logic of the app. 
- **Test** includes unit and integration tests.
